 * Classes implementing this interface are expected to handle logic related to game data or
 * behaviors, such as managing game entities' states, processing movements, and updating
 * the game environment while maintaining integrity.
 *
 * @apiNote The purpose of this interface is to provide an abstraction for any game-related model,
 * ensuring that the underlying implementation adheres to a common design.
